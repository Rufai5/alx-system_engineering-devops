Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 11, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: Web Stack Debugging Service (WSDS) experienced a complete outage, resulting in unavailability for all users. Users were unable to access the service, leading to a 100% impact.

Root Cause: 
An unexpected surge in incoming requests overwhelmed the load balancer, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to distribute traffic effectively. This resulted in a cascading failure, leading to the complete outage of the WSDS.

Timeline:
10:00 AM: The outage was initially detected through a monitoring alert triggered by a sudden increase in latency and a spike in error rates. The operations team was alerted, and investigations began immediately.
10:30 AM: Initial investigations focused on the load balancer, as it was the primary component responsible for traffic distribution. The team inspected its configuration, software, and logs for any signs of misconfiguration or errors.
12:00 PM: No issues were found with the load balancer, prompting further investigations into the application servers and network infrastructure. Logs from both components were analyzed, but no anomalies were detected.
3:00 PM: As the team was unable to identify the root cause, the incident was escalated to the senior engineering team and system architects for further assistance. A crisis conference call was initiated to coordinate efforts and gather additional expertise.
5:00 PM: An in-depth review of the monitoring data revealed a significant increase in incoming requests around the time of the outage. Suspicion turned towards a potential external factor causing the surge.
7:00 PM: After extensive debugging and analysis, it was discovered that a misconfigured API integration with a popular social media platform was the cause of the surge in incoming requests. The integration was designed to fetch data for analytics purposes but had inadvertently caused an excessive number of requests to be sent to the WSDS.
10:00 PM: The misconfigured API integration was immediately disabled, and the load balancer was restarted to restore its functionality. Rate limiting measures were also implemented to prevent a similar overload in the future.
2:00 AM: The WSDS was fully restored, and normal service resumed
.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfigured API integration with the social media platform. This integration was designed to fetch data for analytics purposes but had inadvertently caused an excessive number of requests to be sent to the WSDS. As the surge in incoming requests surpassed the load balancer's capacity, it became unresponsive and failed to distribute traffic effectively, resulting in the complete outage of the WSDS.
To resolve the issue, the misconfigured API integration was immediately disabled, ensuring that no further excessive requests were sent to the WSDS. The load balancer was restarted to restore its functionality and alleviate the traffic overload. Additionally, rate limiting measures were implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. This would allow the system to gracefully handle incoming requests and prevent overwhelming the load balancer.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improve Load Balancer Scalability: Enhance the load balancer's capacity to handle increased traffic by adding additional resources and conducting load testing to identify optimal configurations. This will ensure that the load balancer can handle unexpected spikes in traffic without becoming overwhelmed.
Monitoring Enhancements: Implement more granular monitoring and alerting systems to detect abnormal traffic patterns and latency spikes, enabling quicker identification of issues. This will allow the operations team to respond promptly and investigate potential problems before they escalate.
API Integration Validation: 
Conduct thorough testing and validation of all existing API integrations to identify any potential misconfigurations or excessive traffic patterns. Implement strict validation checks during the integration process to ensure that only valid and optimized requests are made to the WSDS.
 Conduct Load Testing: 
Simulate high-traffic scenarios to stress-test the load balancer and identify its capacity limitations. This will help determine the load balancer's performance thresholds and ensure that it can handle expected levels of traffic without compromising the service.
